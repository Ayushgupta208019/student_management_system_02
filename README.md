I am developing a comprehensive multi-panel management system with distinct role-based functionalities for HODs, Faculty, Students, and Admin. Each panel has specific permissions tailored to its users:

HOD Panel:

Comprehensive management of students, faculty, timetables, sessions, subjects, courses, and semesters.
Authority to approve or reject leave applications for students and faculty.
Capability to send notifications directly to students.
Faculty Panel:

Manage academic records, including adding, updating, or deleting student results.
Upload documents in various formats (e.g., PDF, TXT) for student access.
Maintain and update hostel and bus information for students.
Student Panel:

Access to view academic results, notifications, and downloadable documents.
View hostel and bus-related details.
Admin Panel:

Administrative functions for overseeing system-wide operations.
Authentication and Authorization:

The project includes a robust user authentication and authorization process, leveraging Django's built-in mechanisms.
Passwords are securely hashed using Djangoâ€™s default security features, ensuring that they are not stored or visible in plain text.
Enhancements and Upcoming Features:

Fee Management: Handling fee-related information and transactions.
Student Categorization: Organizing students based on sections or classes.
Assessment Creation: Enabling HODs to create assessments accessible to students.
Future Features: Expanding functionalities to improve system flexibility and address evolving user needs.
